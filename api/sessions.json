          "description": "My idea is present my expriences while exploring the NFC platform. The applications of NFC reader capabilities present on a phone, as well as the beaming and auto-pairing functionalities.\r\n\r\nNFC, being a low powered hardware, means speeds are in the range of 5kbps, but that is enough for small chunks of data. The best part is there is no need of pairing. Just the phones must be tapped onto each other, i.e. their backs touching each other as long as the communication takes place, and everything will be taken care automatically by the apps. ",
